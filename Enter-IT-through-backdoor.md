# TL,DR

# Introduction
There's so much job in IT, and so few applicants, that HR are now used to hire outside of IT schools.
This is all sound and good: if you spend a few years in university, you're trained to learn new 
things and solve problems. This is basically what you need to start any IT career.
Nevertheless, it's merely an enabler, as so many things can go wrong that you shouldn't take it for granted, neither
indulge in self-deprecation nor leave the field after one attempt.

As I followed a similar path several times (in and outside IT), I'll try to state of few facts I observed 
and suggest some actions, so you can say, at least: "I've done my best - Que sera, sera" (1).  

# As a starter

## I'm not doing as well my peers
I hope so ! People that enter IT after 3 or 6-month intensive training period know much more that a 
freshman, but should not be misled into thinking they will end up with the same skills as graduates.
Pack an 5-year curriculum in a few months is nothing else than a dream.
Remember what's in (technical only): hardware, programming languages, GUI, network, DB, architecture, VCS, IDE...   

## I can't do it, I'm gonna quit before they fire me
If HR hired you, it's become they think you have a potential. They invest a nice pack of money on you,
so it wouldn't make any sense to hire you if you're doomed to fail. Except if you lied and pretend things,
maybe out of necessity, but I can't help you if you went that way.

## OK. So they won't fire me ?   
Well, HR certainly take more risk when hiring you than when hiring a 10-year oldie. They will probably put
a skilled person to be you manager so this risk can be mitigated. This being said, keep in mind you're taking a risk 
much bigger than them, as it's not that easy to get "the first job.". They already had it.

In a few words, this is your career, not theirs. 
So if things go bad, even (or especially) when you play your part and played it hard, if an external factor
was the failure root cause, say they put you on a death-march project (2), they can/may/will fire you.    

# Can you do it ?

To give a try on answering this down-to-earth question, we first need to consider a bunch of things about YOU:
- human
    - can you stand uncertainty 
    - can you stand being different, not as the same level as your peers
- technical 
    - can you learn while doing, especially under project day-to-day moderate pressure
    - can you learn different things at once, being at different level of abstraction (say, architecture and `.bashrc` )
- organizational 
    - are you confortable being a part of a group, frequently working together
    - can you stand the much challenging lightweight processes such as Agile rituals (if your team using them)...
    - ... especially in day-to-day practice as pair/mob-programming or code reviews    
      
## A focus on human
To sum it up, it's all about being OK to be vulnerable.
The first job is emotionally challenging for everyone. Don't miss that will have to keep on learning while working.
 
> Education is about learning to trust others and being vulnerable with others. If you are learning,
you are doing something - at least for a while - you don't know how to do. 
That's a vulnerable position to be in, and as human beings we need to have relationship with some level of trust to do that.
Martin Kulldorff, in The New Yorker Octobre 5, 2020 (0)    
  
So if trust doesn't arise between you and your peers, this will be even more difficult.  
You may not like this "soft" stuff. If you want to know what's at stake, I recommend Brene Brown (3)   
 
## Can you do it in this environment ?
While YOU may be up to this challenge, it isn't just about you. That's when luck (good or bad) come on the stage.

Some environments will allow you plenty of time and support, you'll do it, and maybe, in a couple of years you'll fancy 
about this love story, how everything went so smooth, how it had to be that way. You maybe even boasting about it.

Some other environments will not. They won't tell you about it at the beginning. They may go as far as saying the opposite.
Because (chose any or more of the following):
- they may think they know what is to be a beginner - but they don't, and fail to change gear when it doesn't work as expected
- they may pretend to do so, to avoid being harsh
- they don't have much leeway (money/power) and hope it may work

It may even start well and end badly without you noticing the change.
As Weinberg puts it: "People don't tell you when they stop trusting you".

We can go on chatting about the root causes. 
I'm interested in that stuff (4), but the aim here and now is to keep you on the payroll.

# So, what's the plan ?

## Accept the risk
Acknowledge you can lose: save money and have an emergency plan. Then keep on trying.
You won't know if it can succeed before a couple of months, so be ready for whatever happens in the meanwhile.

## Listen to yourself
Most of the time, you know how you feel. You can fool yourself, but not for too long.
If you feel bad more than one day consecutively, get irritable, experience insomnia, eat/drink more/less than usual...
Well, this is a warning. You just won't make it if you keep going.

You may need help if it persists: seek for a decent psychologist.
Some companies provide psychological assistance hotlines or similar services. 

## Make things clear before

Discuss upfront with everyone what they expect from you, before joining the project:
- your HR
- your manager / operational point of contact on the project
- your client, if you're a contractor
- your peers: ask for a code session together before joining the project
       
It may be painful, but it may turn to be a show-stopper in a few weeks if you skip this step. 

## You'll need to be focussed

Focus while working will help you :
- prevent self-pity and loneliness feelings to arise constantly
- progress step by step, building a foundation you can rely on, instead of wasting time and energy wandering in all directions

## How to be focussed ?

Build a skill completion matrix that will be:
- detailed down to the level the skill assessment is straightforward, leaving no room for debate (eg. define a class static method in Javascript)
- grouped into categories, spanning the whole day-ty-day work, including chores (eg. include setting up IDE, OS maintenance, messaging...)
- including 3 level of achievement: heard-of/understood in theory, practiced with guidance, practiced in autonomy

Use a common pattern:
- first day of week, with a peer who is technically able, check the matrix content and add milestones for next month 
- at end of week, fill in the actual achievements

## You'll need to communicate (a lot)
Make your hierarchic responsible agree with this process and have access to the document.  
Do not accept the impossible, be down-to-earth regarding the way of getting the skill.

As an example, if: 
- you're supposed to use flexbox or grid to implement the next CSS task in the backlog
- your CSS skills amount to no more than selectors and font attributes

You can ask (choose according to context): 
- for a half or full day of tutorials by yourself
- for pair-programming session on CSS kata (if you use production code, chances are you run to the result rather than to the understanding)

You can leave some leeway about what's planned and what actually happens, as sometimes it's better to move with
the flock. But if what's planned doesn't happen within a month, chances are it will never happen at all.

## You'll need to work by yourself, too
As you can't be sure if the company has a genuine involvement (eg. desire and ressources) to allow you enough time
to get on speed, you can choose to buy extra risk mitigation by working by yourself. Especially if basic training is
denied at work, and you know you hardly need it. 

But keep in mind you can't sustain a marathon at sprint speed. I warn against more than:
- 2 hours of personal work per work day;
- 1 day of personal work per weekend;
- 1 week of personal work per holiday period.

## Why would this nitty-gritty matrix thing work ?
In a first job, everything is new, so it's hard to get a feeling of where you are.
You can't know if your progress is steady enough. 
Everybody need some kind of achievement, of quick feedback to sustain its efforts in the right direction.
To feel in control of what's happening, of what to do next. If you can't, you may end up as a rabbit 
in a truck headlights. You think you can't do it so strongly that you actually become miserable. 
You avoid asking for help, you don't challenge others when they ask something you can't deliver.   
Then, a day comes where nobody knows how to get out of this. A self-fulfilling prophecy.

It doesn't mean the play will come to a happy end if you try the matrix way. As I mentioned earlier,
there's a lot of conflicting forces acting in a IT project. The fact that it's much easier to control your 
technical skill learning doesn't mean it will be enough. It simply means that, if you have to leave, you leave
with a solid technical foundation for the next step. Something to mention on your resume. 

This rationale has a deliberate stoicist taste, that you may find bitter
> That alone is in our power, which is our own work; and in this class are our opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. 
What, on the contrary, is not in our power, are our bodies, possessions, glory, and power. 
Any delusion on this point leads to the greatest errors, misfortunes, and troubles, and to the slavery of the soul (5)

# As a conclusion
Of course, everything can happen so smoothly that you never have to worry. Maybe the very fact of being suspicious,
of being on your guard can cause problems. You'll have to do the hard stuff anyway: decide by your own. 
I hope this article gave you some insights.
