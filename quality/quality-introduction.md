# Quality, an introduction

## Quality in software development

A brief exchange took place on a software crafter forum on "overquality".
The basic question was the following example from [linguee](https://www.linguee.fr/anglais-francais/traduction/overquality.html) 
>Implementing the quality system must not result in a cost premium, that is to say, «overquality».

A friend recently told me such a word was intended as a weapon. I could have dropped the subject,
as another example of [rhetoric technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation).
However, the "quality" word is simply all over the place in IT, even we may miss it: 
"QA" is not another name for manual test but stands for "Quality assurance".
Quality may be a very useful concept; if so, so how can it be turned into a weapon ?

## Quality and software craftsmanship

Here is a typical sequence:
- some software is about to be built;
- customer wants quality software;
- a crafter's goal is quality work (["Raising the bar"](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)), so hiring "software crafters" developer look like a good idea;
- delivery date is not met, developer are blamed for overquality and put under pressure;
- then bugs slips in production, developer are blamed for delivering bad quality

Everyone one speak about quality as if it was something obvious, but nobody agrees to what it is in practice.

## The trap of language

Can language, one of the few way we have to build and share an understanding, produce confusion or increase ignorance ?
It can, in both of these two extremes:
- everything looks unique, we cannot find similarities: reality appears too complex or meaningless, and we're helpless;
- everything look similar: reality appears simple, but nothing works, and we're helpless again. 

So, if we don't want to fall in traps we set up for ourselves, we need to share definitions that are: 
- neither too narrow, so we can make analogies and be understood;
- nor too vague, to prevent surface agreements.

In this sequence of 3 articles, I will gather most occurrences of "quality" word in craftsmanship, manufacturing and software craftsmanship books.
We'll come against similarities and contradictions. In the end, I hope you will have built a map in your mind, so you can decide where you want to go.

## A warning

A last word: the mere word "quality" suggest a direction, a change and progress, a "better way" toward a "greater good".
I won't go into ethical and aesthetical grounds, but I must say that political concerns are not very far.

> Political purpose – using the word ‘political’ in the widest possible sense. 
> Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of the kind of society that they should strive after.
> Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias.
