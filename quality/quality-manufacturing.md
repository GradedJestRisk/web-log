# Quality in manufacturing

## An unusual place to start

I want to start with quality as defined by [W. Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming): who has more intimately associated his name with it?
The mere fact that dustjacket entitle him "Father of total quality" can make one smile, but stands for it.
[Manufacturing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manufacture) may not be the first place that came in mind when 
talking about quality: a potter shop comes to mind more easily. Well, anything that involve handcraft does.
Some would even go as far as considering artists, but everything will come in time. So let's disregard for 
the moment [manufacturing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manufacture) etymology (making by hand).

## Deming's definition

> A suitable definition (for quality of medical care) is a perennial problem.
> It seems simple to anyone that has not tried it.
