# Quality in manufacturing

## An unusual place to start

I want to start with quality as defined by [W. Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming): who has more intimately associated his name with it?
The mere fact that dustjacket entitle him "Father of total quality" can make one smile, but stands for it.
[Manufacturing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manufacture) may not be the first place that came in mind when 
talking about quality: a potter shop comes to mind more easily. Well, anything that involve handcraft does.
Some would even go as far as considering artists, but everything will come in time. So let's disregard for 
the moment [manufacturing](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manufacture) etymology (making by hand).

## Deming's definition

We can think that defining a software application quality is difficult because of our ignorance of the
object, the software. We may think it's related to our limited knowledge: paper industry's experts can 
define the quality of a blank sheet of paper, whereas we cannot. 

So let's take an example that look like unambiguous: define the quality of something everyone experienced,
a hospital. If you try to list such criteria for yourself, you may end up in difficult situation.
As Deming said:
> A suitable definition for quality (of medical care) is a perennial problem.
> It seems simple to anyone that has not tried it.

_Out of the crisis, chapter "Quality and the consumer"_

He offers the following definition 

> What is quality ? A product of a service possesses quality if it helps somebody 
> and enjoys a good a sustainable market.

_The new Economics, chapter "How are we doing ?"_

This definition sounds fuzzy, especially for an expert of statistics like Deming, but put forward:
- quality can only be assessed in consumer use;
- quality involve a long-term and balanced relationship between producer and consumer.

To put it bluntly, if a state provide to its citizens free medical care, it cannot have quality unless:
- people are cured;
- physicians and nurses are not fired frequently or perpetually exhausted;
- taxes are moderate.
